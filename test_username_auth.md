## 🧪 How to Test

### **Test 1: Existing User Login**
1. **Open your application** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Go to login page**
3. **Try logging in** with a username generated from your existing email
   - If email was `john.doe@email.com`, username should be `john.doe`
   - If there were duplicates, it might be `john.doe_2`, etc.

### **Test 2: New User Registration**
1. **Go to registration page**
2. **Fill out the form** including the new username field
3. **Submit registration**
4. **Check that username is required** and validated

### **Test 3: Admin/Employee Login**
1. **Try logging in** with admin/employee usernames
2. **Verify redirects** work correctly based on role

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Login Doesn't Work:**
1. **Check database** - verify usernames were generated:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, username FROM customer_accounts LIMIT 5;
   SELECT email, username FROM employees LIMIT 5;
   SELECT email, username FROM users LIMIT 5;
   ```

2. **Check browser console** for any errors

3. **Check backend logs** for authentication errors

### **If Registration Doesn't Work:**
1. **Check username validation** - make sure username is unique
2. **Check required fields** - username should be required
3. **Check database constraints** - username should be unique
